Technical Project about what Former President Bill Clinton said in his speech to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte:
“Since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24. In those 52
years, our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So, what’s the job score? Republicans 24 million,
Democrats 42 (million).”
